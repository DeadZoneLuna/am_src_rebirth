I've solved the crash, but there is some sound problems when the player enters on water (there isn't sound
at all). So, I won't use it on this version.

If you want to use this files you should link "...common/fmod/fmodvc.lib" in your compiler's option.
Remember to init your Fmod system.

Cheers and happy coding!
