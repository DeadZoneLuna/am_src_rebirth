ARRANGEMODE : REBIRTH - SOURCE CODE
======================

Introduction
----------

This is the source code of the Half-Life 1 mod : ARRANGEMODE : REBIRTH.

[This source code has been released by ARRANGEMODE : REBIRTH's creator Claudio "SysOp" Ficara on the ARRANGEMENT's forums in **August 7th 2008**](http://am.half-lifecreations.com/forums/index.php?topic=90.0). **With the exception of this README and licenses adapted to the Markdown format, nothing has been changed.** The main purpose of having the source code uploaded on GitHub is to have a "Git ready" version.

Please note that the **game itself is no longer supported by it's original developers.**

Usage
----------

In order to compile the source code, you **must use Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0**. It is also recommended to have the Service Pack 6 installed as well. You must **use the "Debug" configuration for the "client" project and the "Release" configuration for the "hl" project**. If you wish to use the 3D sound feature (warning : it will crash your game if you enter water), you must include the proper FMOD files.

In order to run the mod, you **must have the game assets and a Steam account with Half-Life 1 installed**, you can download the game assets and patches from **July 1st 2008** [here](http://am.half-lifecreations.com/forums/index.php?topic=8.0).

If you consider creating a Half-Life 1 mod or total conversation using features from this source code. **We highly recommend that you use a clean Half-Life 1 source code (2.3/GitHub/Xash3D) and use this source code as reference**.

A word of warning : you may also find some code (mostly comments) written in Spanish instead of English.

Maintenance
----------

**No support will be offered for this source code and the game itself, this means that any issue report/pull request will be denied/ignored**.
